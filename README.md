# MCP Human Loop Server

A Model Context Protocol server that manages human-agent collaboration through a sequential scoring system.

## Core Concept

This server acts as an intelligent middleware that determines when human intervention is necessary in AI agent operations. Instead of treating human involvement as a binary decision, it uses a sequential scoring system that evaluates multiple dimensions of a request before deciding if human input is required.

## Scoring System

The server evaluates requests through a series of scoring gates. Each gate represents a specific dimension that might require human intervention. A request only proceeds to human review if it triggers threshold values in any of these dimensions:

1. **Complexity Score**
   - Evaluates if the task is too complex for autonomous agent handling
   - Considers factors like number of steps, dependencies, and decision branches
   - Example: Multi-step tasks with uncertain outcomes score higher

2. **Permission Score**
   - Assesses if the requested action requires human authorization
   - Based on predefined permission levels and action types
   - Example: Financial transactions above certain amounts require human approval

3. **Risk Score**
   - Measures potential impact and reversibility of actions
   - Considers both direct and indirect consequences
   - Example: Actions affecting multiple systems or user data score higher

4. **Emotional Intelligence Score**
   - Determines if the task requires human emotional understanding
   - Evaluates context and user state
   - Example: User frustration or sensitive situations trigger human involvement

5. **Confidence Score**
   - Reflects the agent's certainty about its proposed action
   - Lower confidence triggers human review
   - Example: Edge cases or unusual patterns lower confidence

## Flow Logic

1. Agent submits request to server
2. Server evaluates scores in sequence
3. If any score exceeds its threshold → Route to human
4. If all scores pass → Allow autonomous agent action
5. Track and log all decisions for system improvement

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Only truly necessary cases reach human operators
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new scoring dimensions
- **Tunability**: Thresholds can be adjusted based on experience
- **Transparency**: Clear decision path for each human intervention
- **Learning**: System improves through tracked outcomes

## Future Improvements

- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on outcome tracking
- Machine learning integration for score calculation
- Real-time threshold adjustment based on operator load
- Integration with external risk assessment systems
